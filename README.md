# The CIA Triad: Foundation of Information Security
The CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—serves as the foundational framework for all cybersecurity decision-making because it captures the three essential ways that information can be compromised or protected. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information remains accessible only to authorized parties, integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered, and availability ensures that systems and information remain accessible when needed. What makes this model particularly powerful is recognizing that these three principles often exist in dynamic tension with each other: implementing stronger confidentiality controls might reduce system availability through added authentication steps, while prioritizing availability might require accepting some confidentiality risks through simplified access controls. The 2024 Change Healthcare ransomware attack perfectly illustrates this tension—the organization's emphasis on availability (maintaining seamless access for healthcare providers nationwide) led them to skip multi-factor authentication on remote access systems, which ultimately compromised all three pillars when attackers exploited this weakness. This breach demonstrates why cybersecurity professionals must carefully balance these competing priorities rather than treating them as independent goals, making strategic trade-offs based on organizational risk tolerance and the specific threats they face.

# Foundational Networking Models and Protocols
A rigorous understanding of network communication is predicated on two principal conceptual frameworks: the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and the TCP/IP model. The OSI model is a seven-layer theoretical construct developed by the International Organization for Standardization. It provides a comprehensive, vendor-neutral, and prescriptive framework for understanding the disparate functions involved in network communication, from the physical transmission of bits to the application-level data exchange. Its granular, seven-layer structure (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application) renders it an invaluable tool for academic instruction and systematic network troubleshooting, allowing engineers to isolate problems to a specific functional layer. In contrast, the TCP/IP model is a more pragmatic, four-layer descriptive architecture (Network Access, Internet, Transport, Application) that directly corresponds to the suite of protocols upon which the modern internet was actually built and operates today. While the OSI model offers a more detailed, abstract categorization of functions and is considered the ideal reference, the TCP/IP model represents a more practical implementation, mapping directly to the real-world protocols that govern data flow.


# Difference between TCP and UDP
At the Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4), communication is primarily managed by two distinct protocols: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The principal distinction lies in their approach to data reliability and session management. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that guarantees the ordered and error-checked delivery of a data stream, making it a "reliable" protocol. To achieve this, it establishes a formal connection via a process known as the three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK). During this process, control packets with specific flags (SYN for synchronize, ACK for acknowledge) are exchanged to synchronize sequence numbers and establish a stateful session before any data is transmitted. This stateful mechanism, along with flow control and error checking, ensures data integrity at the cost of higher overhead, evidenced by its larger header size (20 bytes). Conversely, UDP is a connectionless protocol that offers a "best-effort" datagram service. With a minimal header (8 bytes), it provides no guarantees of delivery, ordering, or error correction, resulting in significantly lower overhead and higher speed. This makes UDP suitable for time-sensitive applications like Voice over IP (VoIP), online gaming, or DNS queries, where speed is more critical than perfect reliability. TCP, by contrast, is essential for applications like web browsing (HTTP/S), file transfers (FTP), and secure shell (SSH), where data integrity is paramount.
