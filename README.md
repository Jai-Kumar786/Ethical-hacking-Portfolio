# The CIA Triad: Foundation of Information Security
The CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—serves as the foundational framework for all cybersecurity decision-making because it captures the three essential ways that information can be compromised or protected. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information remains accessible only to authorized parties, integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered, and availability ensures that systems and information remain accessible when needed. What makes this model particularly powerful is recognizing that these three principles often exist in dynamic tension with each other: implementing stronger confidentiality controls might reduce system availability through added authentication steps, while prioritizing availability might require accepting some confidentiality risks through simplified access controls. The 2024 Change Healthcare ransomware attack perfectly illustrates this tension—the organization's emphasis on availability (maintaining seamless access for healthcare providers nationwide) led them to skip multi-factor authentication on remote access systems, which ultimately compromised all three pillars when attackers exploited this weakness. This breach demonstrates why cybersecurity professionals must carefully balance these competing priorities rather than treating them as independent goals, making strategic trade-offs based on organizational risk tolerance and the specific threats they face.
